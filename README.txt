This is my mod for Quake 4.
There are 3 new weapons, the Whip, Fireball wand, and the Lightning Wand, which replace the shotgun, napalm gun and lightning gun respectively. 
These new weapons can be obtained by obtaining the weapons they override, whether it be through the give command in the consle or through playing the story. 
In addition selecting a character will start with you with one of the 3 weapons. 

Upon loading into the map, you will be prompted to choose between 3 different character loadouts. 
Pressing the “1”,”2” or, “3’ keys on the keyboard will select that character and give you the respective items and buffs. 
In addition, the player can open an upgrade menu by typing the command “levelup” into the console and use the “1”,”2” or, “3’ keys to choose an upgrade, or press “4” to skip receiving a reward. 

The “.” key also opens a help menu which explains many of the same things listed within this file. Have Fun!
